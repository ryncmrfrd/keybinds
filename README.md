# ⌨️ Autohotkey Numpad Keybinds

Inspired by [Taran Van Hermert](https://www.youtube.com/@TaranVH), and more specifically [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arn8ExQ2Gjg), I wrote this short script so I could use my external numpad as a macro keyboard. These macros are:

* 🎙️ Discord mute/deaden
* 🎶 Spotify-specific volume adjustment
* ⏯️ Media keys (play/pause, next, previous)

> Being my first experience with [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), this script isn't my best work, but it does what is says on the tin, and that's all I need. I may add some more features in future to reflect my changing needs (eg. program launches, VS code functions), but for now it works.
